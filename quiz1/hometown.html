                        <p class="hometown__description">Yogyakarta is a bustling town of some half a million 
                            people and the most popular tourist destination on Java, largely thanks to its 
                            proximity to the temples of Borobudur and Prambanan. The town is a hub of art 
                            and education, offers some good shopping and has a wide range of tourist facilities.

                            Strictly speaking, the city (kota) of Yogyakarta is only one of five districts 
                            within the semi-autonomous region of Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta (DIY), literally 
                            the "Yogyakarta Special Region". (The other districts are Sleman on the slopes 
                            of fiery Mount Merapi to the North, Bantul all the way to the sea to the South, 
                            the hills of Gunungkidul to the East and the low lands of Kulon Progo to the West.) 
                            This special status is thanks to the Sultanate of Hamengkubuwono, which has ruled 
                            the area since 1755 and steered the state through difficult times of occupation and 
                            revolution. During the Indonesian war of independence, Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX offered 
                            the fledgling Indonesian government his enclave as capital city, thus Yogyakarta became 
                            the revolutionary capital city of the republic from 1946 to 1949 when Jakarta was 
                            still occupied by the Dutch. As a result, the central government recognized the 
                            Sultan of Yogyakarta as the appointed governor of Yogyakarta Special Region; 
                            the only one in Indonesia that is not elected directly by the people. 
                            The Indonesian central government has tried to weaken the sultan's power 
                            by calling for direct election for the governor, however the present Sultan 
                            Hamengkubuwono X was chosen by an overwhelming majority.</p>
